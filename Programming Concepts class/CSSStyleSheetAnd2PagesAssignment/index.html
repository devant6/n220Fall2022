        <p>Cats are great. I have two of them, and they're both amazing. One of them is a fluffy white cat who absolutely adores my dad, and follows him everywhere.</p><br>
        <p>My other cat is a calico cat that adores me and sleeps on me all the time. She drinks water out of the sink, and is extremely demanding when she wants something.</p>
